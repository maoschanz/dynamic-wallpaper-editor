# Dynamic Wallpaper Editor

The GNOME desktop allows the wallpaper to change with time.

These dynamic wallpapers are XML files, and you don't want to write these files yourself: Dynamic Wallpaper Editor is a little utility for the creation or the edition of these XML wallpapers.

## Edit XML files

Easily open an XML file, add pictures, or remove pictures, or change their order or their durations, and save the modifications.

## Set an XML file as a wallpaper

An existing XML file (opened, or just created) can be set as your wallpaper from the app.

Adjustment options are available (mosaic, zoom, centered, etc.)
